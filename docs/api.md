## Households
- POST /households  {"name": "...", "defaultCurrency": "USD" (optional)} -> 201
- GET /households/{id} -> 200 | 404
- PATCH /households/{id}  {"name": "..."} -> 200 | 400 | 404
Name is trimmed and must be 1-80 characters (400 otherwise). Unknown or malformed ids return 404.
Errors use the standard ApiError body. All routes require the X-Api-Key header.

- POST /households/{id}/people/{personId}/archive -> 200 | 404
  Marks the person as having left. Archived people are hidden from GET /households/{id}/people unless
  ?includeArchived=true, cannot be newly assigned to receipt items (ArchivedPersonException in the
  repository), and still appear as owners on existing receipts. Archiving twice is harmless.
